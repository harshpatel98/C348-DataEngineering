# Loops and Data Structures
In this module, we will look at building more robust data types and scripts in Python. Specifically, we will look at loops that allow a block of code to repeat as necessary, and we will look at more advanced data collections including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

## Lessons
By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

- [Basic Data Structures]()
- [Loops]()
- [Dictionaries & Sets](​)

## TURN IN ASSIGNMENTS
